# FYS-STK4155 - Project 2 - Feed-Forward Neural Network for linear and logistic regression
Repository for Project 2 in FYS-STK4155 - FF Neural Network for linear and logistic regression<br /><br />
Here you'll find the programs, project report, and some additional results produced for the second project in the subject FYS-STK4155 at UiO.<br /><br />
The folder structure is:
- **01-main**: <br />Folder for the programs, class-files and other support files used in the project
- **02-report**: <br /> The written report and .tex-files used to generate the report. The report has a section on how to use the program, and the algorithms used.
- **04-figures**: <br />A selection of figures and results generated during the project. This also includes a jupyter-notebook which allows the user to generate some of the figures for here, and in the report, using the program-files. This requires that the same folder structure is kept as-is.
- **09-archive**: <br />Preliminary files not used in the final version of the project
